# Github Monaspace

The Monaspace type system: a monospaced type superfamily with some modern tricks up its sleeves. It is comprised of five variable axis typefaces. Each one has a distinct voice, but they are all metrics-compatible with one another, allowing you to mix and match them for a more expressive typographical palette.
